# Landing_page_fundamental
This project is part of ODIN Project classes
At this point we should build a Landing page using the previous tools we`ve learned, as flex box variations, links and buttons.

The theme inspired me was an hotel landing page, focused on get potential hosts attention to spend some days in one of earth`s paradise.

The hotel does not exist, I just put some pictures and informations together, but this is one of the areas I really think about develop (tourism).
